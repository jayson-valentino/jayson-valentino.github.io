<p>Targeted for students, the Drip Machine was designed to serve up shots by the volume. You can make up to 8 drinks in less than one minute. Its efficient with its speed, crowd management, spillage of drinks, etc. Due to the integrated POS, its easy to keep a track of your sales with automated collection & generation of pouring information.</p>
<h2 style="color:black;">What We Did</h2>
<p>The automated bartending machine was designed and engineered from the ground up. It is made out of multiple ml-accurate pumps, mazes of food-grade tubing, dual-screen ad displays, a fully-customized backend, a payment console and a touchscreen display for control.</p>
<p>This machine exemplifies PixelPlusMediaâ€™s capabilities in product design and development.</p>
