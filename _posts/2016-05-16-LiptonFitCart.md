<p>A gym on wheels in a supermarket and could calculate your distance, calories burnt, steps, and time you spend at the supermarket.</p>
<p>The idea, was get people to understand that they could make healthier choices even when doing something as mundane as shopping for groceries – all that they needed, was a disruption. This is when we invented a revolutionary technology – The Lipton Green Tea Fit Cart, which took over a year to build. This was a gym on wheels in a supermarket and could calculate your distance, calories burnt, steps, and time you spend at the supermarket. A few relevant numbers in the right place at the right time eventually would spark lifestyle change and get people to subconsciously choose to be healthy in their shopping habits, and consequently in their daily habits.</p>
<h2 style="color:black;">Execution</h2>
<p>We began by replacing regular shopping carts with our Fit Carts in various supermarkets. As part of the shopping process, we saw people conscientiously watch their fitness data accumulate as they pushed faster and shopped longer – all with health in mind. Groceries had a new agenda. The activation became a starting point, triggering what Lipton likes to call ‘#LiveGood reactions’. Once aware of their own natural metabolic function, shoppers took more steps and burned more calories in the supermarket itself. They even opted for greener, healthier, more wholesome foods. The cart was placed in stores delivering an explicit brand encounter, while a digital film was an online tool to further communicate Lipton Green Tea’s 'Live Good' message – a low-effort, high-benefit metaphor for its green tea product.</p>

<h2 style="color:black;">Result</h2>

The campaign, in simple words, was all about having customers push a cardio-customized shopping cart around a grocery store as part of their shopping experience, and observing changes in their health and fitness-related behavior. The cart was placed in stores delivering an explicit brand encounter, while a digital film was an online tool to further communicate Lipton Green Tea’s ‘Live Good’ message – a low-effort, high-benefit metaphor for its green tea product.</p>

We needed to find ways for people to easily adopt a healthier lifestyle. We found NEAT. Coined by Dr. James Levine in the early 2000’s, Non Exercise Activity Thermogenesis refers to all that energy expended for everything we do other than sleeping, eating or sports-like exercises. Research found that it plays an important role in weight loss or gain. Simple: if you are conscious about trivial everyday activities that require expending energy and embrace as much of them as you can, you are already living a healthier life. We then started analyzing the impact of wearables like Fitbit had on people. we found that users of this devices were extremely conscious about the amount of calories they were burning. If they didn’t consume a lot of energy in exercises, their diet for the day and choices would change. Our concept: Simple choices are the first step to a healthier lifestyle.</p>
