<h2 style="color:black;">What We Did</h2>
<p>To keep with the theme of the activation, we suggested the use of mobile boarding passes which were dynamically created for each guest registration sent prior to the event. Guests would then be able to use these passes to interact with an interactive memory game, a photo-booth and the access gate to  the VIP section.</p>

<p>Stand technologies also featured a centralized digital display management system  that announced raffle results live.</p>
