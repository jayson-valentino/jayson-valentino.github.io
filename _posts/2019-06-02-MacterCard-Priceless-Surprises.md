<h2 style="color:black;">I think i programmed the tallest vending machine in world! :D</h2>
<p>We designed and built the custom vending machine, event system, social LED column and the stand for this activation.</p><p>Customers with receipts over AED 1000 were invited to participate in our activation. They receive a surprise token which, when inserted into the vending machine, dispenses various gifts and surprises from participating retailers at the Dubai Mall.</p>
