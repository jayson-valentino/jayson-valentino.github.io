<p>Our aim was to create several interactive games for kids and adults alike. Kids from different schools were brought onto our stand to experience this. We had different kinds of interactive games – VR based maze, a Kinect based runner game vending machine, a segregation game, a candy-crush-type game, a logic-based pathfinding game and an augmented reality photobooth experience.</p>
<h2 style="color:black;">What We Did</h2>
<p>The digital activation was designed to encourage interaction through five different touch points through a RFiD registration system that ensures an omni-channel data flow for the Sharjah Government’s mobile video game which was being developed in parallel with the show.</p>
<h2 style="color:black;">Result</h2>
<p>Users were asked to register through a mobile RFiD registration. Once done, the guests will be able to interact and play for points in the 4 different digital activations in the stand. These points would later be reflected in the user’s profile when they log on to the mobile video game.</p>

<p><b>The five activations were:</b></p>
<ul style="color:black;">
<li>Sorting Game – a touch screen sorting game, users sort through waste and put them in the correct bin. The more you sort, the more points you earn!</li>
<li>VR Maze – a 3D maze in an alien world, two players compete to solve the maze in 60 seconds. Who gets out first wins!</li>
<li>Interactive Vending Machine – an endless runner game, the user hops from side to side in order to avoid obstacles in our character’s path.</li>
<li>Drone Challenge – create the shortest path to your goal and recover precious artifacts. A pathfinding game, this challenged the user’s ability to think quickly and solve our puzzle.</li>
<li>Gem Sorting Puzzle – mix and match gems to collect them!</li>
<li>Augmented Reality Photoooth – become future ready. The users can wear different costumes to pick their future profession.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:black;">Meet the team!</h2>
