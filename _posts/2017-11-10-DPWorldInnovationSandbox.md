<p>To celebrate Dubai’s Innovation Month, we worked with DP World’s Innovation Team to deliver an immersive experiential pop up museum for the public. It included a 360 Projection Room, an interactive projection wall, a crane simulation activation, a custom unity game, an hydroponic setup, a drone delivery system, a proximity activated tribute to Sheikh Zayed and other captivating content.</p>
<p>Drone technology, the Internet of Things(IOT) and intelligent tech solutions employed at DP World’s global operations were on display at their ‘Innovation Sandbox’ at Kite Beach in Dubai recently, which hosted more than 7,000 people and had over 25,000 online visits through a virtual tour.</p>
<p>Marking the UAE Innovation Month, the global trade enabler showcased its latest trade solutions at a beach-side multi-level structure, including a driver fatigue monitoring and control system, which is installed in trucks to keep drivers alert especially during night shifts. Sensors are mounted on dashboards to monitor driver activity including alertness. The system is on trialat DP World’s flagship Jebel Ali Port in Dubai, and is being implemented at its Busan terminal in South Korea, and ATI Manila and Batangas terminals in the Philippines.</p><p>A wireless monitoring device using Internet of Things (IOT) technology to detect equipment failure and defects was also on display, as well as surveillance drones that monitor activities through live video feeds and locations away from fixed camera networks. Another drone cleaned camera lenses, while 'Innovation Sandbox' visitors were able to get food delivered fromnearby restaurants by drones.</p>
