<p>After over four months of collaboration, we helped deliver and find solutions for the digital engagements that were proposed for the stand by another supplier. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ARKit-based Augmented Reality App that uses SLAM to track and overlay AR Content over space rather than the traditional marker-based tracking system;</li>
<li>A Live-Rendered 3D Interactive Transparent OLED App that showcased Masdarâ€™s global projects and initiatives;</li>
<li>A 2.5mm Social Media Column that aggregates social hashtag data and displays it through a seamless LED column that is synced with some scenic lights;</li>
<li>A data capture app that dispenses brochures digitally.</li>
</ul>
